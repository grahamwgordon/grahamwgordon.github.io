				<li>  	Imagine the equator runs through an island, and two people are standing on opposite ends of the island
					where the equator meets the shore.
					Each has a satellite phone which displays the location and elevation of both people and allows them to communicate.
					Assuming the interior of the island stays above sea level,
					is it possible for them to hike along the equator and meet on the island all while maintaining
					the same elevation as each other?
					(This is a retelling of Exer. 1.3.10 in the first edition of West's <i>Introduction to Graph Theory</i>;
					the original phrasing was communicated by D. Hoffman.)
