				<li>  	Imagine the equator runs through an island, and two people are standing on opposite ends of the island
					where the equator meets the shore.
					Each has a satellite phone which displays the location and elevation of both people and allows them to communicate.
					Assuming the interior of the island stays above sea level,
					is it possible for them to hike along the equator and meet on the island all while maintaining
					the same elevation as each other?
					(This is a retelling of Exer. 1.3.10 in the first edition of West's <i>Introduction to Graph Theory</i>;
					the original phrasing was communicated by D. Hoffman.)
				</li>
				<li>
					An airline operates flights between any two capital cities in the European Union.
					Each flight has a fixed price which is the same in both directions.
					Furthermore, the flight prices from any given city are pairwise distinct.
					Anna and Bella wish to visit each city exactly once, not necessarily starting from the same city.
					While Anna always takes the cheapest flight from her current city to some city she hasn't visited yet,
					Bella always continues her tour with the most expensive flight available.
					Is it true that Bella's tour will surely cost at least as much as Anna's tour?
					(According to Ted Alper, this comes from a Hungarian math competition.)

			Geometry

			<ol>
				<li>
					Given four points \[a,b,c,d\] on a line in the plane,
					construct a square such that the parallel lines through one pair of the square's opposite sides
					intersect \[a\] and \[b\]... and the parallel lines throught the other pair of the square's opposite sides
					intersect \[c\] and \[d\].
					(From a Hungarian problem book.)
