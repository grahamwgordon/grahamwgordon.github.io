    How much cheese and/or meat to eat?

  <h2>
    The situation
  </h2>

  <p>
    I want to eat some cheese and meat. Here are the nutrition labels for them.


  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <img src="images/cheesefacts.png">
      <figcaption>
        Cheese nutrition label
      </figcaption>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="images/meatfacts.png">
      <figcaption>
        Meat nutrition label
      </figcaption>
    </div>
  </div>

  Not pictured are the prices, which are $4.29 for the cheese and $8.69 for the meat.
  Anyway, I am mostly interested in getting a sufficient amount of protein (at least 20 g) without breaking the bank or
  getting too much sodium (600 mg).
  </p>

  <h2>
    The algebra
  </h2>

  <p>
    I decided to use \(x\) to denote the number of servings of cheese and \(y\) the number of servings of meat I would
    eat together for a snack (or a meal?).
    Based on the nutrition labels, I created two inequalities based on my conditions for protein and sodium:
    \[ 7x + 11y \geq 20 \]
    \[ 170x + 410y \leq 600 \]
    I also created the following cost function:
    \[ f(x,y) = 0.715x + 2.897y \]
  </p>

  <h2>
    The optimization
  </h2>

  <p>
    I graphed the two inequalities, the protein in red and the sodium in blue, as shown in the graph below.
    The purple-gray-ish region where they overlap (also known as the "feasible region") contains all the points that
    satisfy both of my condition for protein and sodium.
    You can drag the purple dot around, and it will show you how much it costs to purchase the corresponding number of
    servings of cheese and meat.
    <br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <b>Optimization goal:</b> find the point in the feasible region that has the smallest cost.
  </p>
  Go ahead, try it!
  </p>

  <h2>
    The results
  </h2>

  <p>
    As we learned in class, the cost function hits its largest and smallest values on the corners of the feasible
    region, so we really only have to check three points: the top, the bottom-left, and the bottom-right. The cheapest
    one is (drum roll please)
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <b>(2.85,0)</b> which means I should eat nearly 3 servings of cheese and no meat whatsoever.
  </p>
  This is rather anticlimactic, and so I might adjust my behavior based on personal taste, or I might adjust the
  constraints of my optimization to try to introduce some variety.
